Blood transfusion safety is a relevant and significant public health issue . Since most blood banks are still in paper-based system, various disadvantages are experienced by various stakeholders, which endanger the lives of patients and deter the healthcare system. As such, that we aim to design, develop, and implement an online blood bank management system (OBBMS). This web-based application allows hospitals to make inventories of their blood bags online, subsequently, allowing each hospital to check the availability of blood bags anytime. The researchers designed and administered a questionnaire that assess the perceptions of various stakeholders in both manual-based and OBBMS.
